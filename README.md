# Hole project

It's a simple project. I took a project that wrote and didn't run and changed it. It has to show my skills.
The project has only frontend part, because a backend part coded in PHP some other people.
I want to add a backend and I'm going to write on Javascript and also continue coding the frontend.
You can see some components don't use. It's because they will use then.
